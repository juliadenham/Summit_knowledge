# Blue-footed booby

The **blue-footed booby** (***Sula nebouxii***) is a [marine
bird](marine_bird "wikilink") native to subtropical and tropical regions
of the eastern [Pacific Ocean](Pacific_Ocean "wikilink"). It is one of
six species of the genus *[Sula](booby "wikilink")* – known as boobies.
It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is
a [sexually selected](sexual_selection "wikilink") trait and a product
of their diet. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by
lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. The female
is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) 
long with a wingspan up to 1.5 m (5 ft).

The natural breeding habitats of the blue-footed booby are the tropical
and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the
[Gulf of California](Gulf_of_California "wikilink") south along the
western coasts of Central and South America to [Peru](Peru "wikilink").
About half of all breeding pairs nest on the [Galápagos
Islands](Galápagos_Islands "wikilink"). Its diet mainly consists of
fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming under water in
search of its prey. It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in
groups.

The blue-footed booby usually lays one to three eggs at a time. The
species practices asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other
species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all
chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size
disparity between siblings, leading to [facultative
siblicide](siblicide "wikilink") in times of food scarcity. This
makes the blue-footed booby an [important
model](Model_organism "wikilink") for studying [parent–offspring
conflict](parent–offspring_conflict "wikilink") and [sibling
rivalry](Sibling_rivalry_(animals) "wikilink").

## Taxonomy

The blue-footed booby was described by the French naturalist [Alphonse
Milne-Edwards](Alphonse_Milne-Edwards "wikilink") in 1882 under the
current [binomial name](binomial_name "wikilink") *Sula nebouxii*.
The [specific epithet](Specific_name_(zoology) "wikilink") was chosen to
honor the surgeon, naturalist, and explorer [Adolphe-Simon
Neboux](Adolphe-Simon_Neboux "wikilink") (1806–1844). There are two
recognized [subspecies](subspecies "wikilink"):

- The subspecies S. n. nebouxii is distributed across the Pacific coast of Southern and Middle America.
- The subspecies S. n. excisa Todd, 1948 is distributed across the Galápagos Islands.

Its closest relative is the [Peruvian booby](Peruvian_booby "wikilink").
The two species likely split from each other recently due to their
shared ecological and biological characteristics. A 2011 study of
multiple genes calculated the two species diverged between 1.1 and 0.8
million years ago.

The name booby comes from the Spanish word *bobo* ("stupid", "foolish",
or "clown") because the blue-footed booby is, like other seabirds,
clumsy on land. They are also regarded as foolish for their apparent
fearlessness of humans.

## Description

The blue-footed booby is on average 81 cm (32 in) long and weighs 
1.5 kg (3 1⁄4 lb), with the female
being slightly larger than the male. Its wings are long, pointed, and
brown in color. The neck and head of the blue-footed booby are light
brown with white streaks, while the belly and underside exhibit pure
white plumage. Its eyes are placed on either side of its bill and
oriented towards the front, enabling excellent [binocular
vision](binocular_vision "wikilink"). Its eyes are a distinctive yellow,
with the male having more yellow in its irises than the female.
Blue-footed booby chicks have black beaks and feet and are clad in a
layer of soft white down. The subspecies *S. n. excisa* that breeds on
the Galápagos Islands is larger than the [nominate
subspecies](nominate_subspecies "wikilink") and has lighter plumage
especially around the neck and head.

The Peruvian booby is similar in appearance, but has grey feet, whiter
head and neck, and white spots on its wing coverts. The ranges of the
two species overlap in the waters of northern Peru and southern
Ecuador.

Since the blue-footed booby preys on fish by diving headlong into the
water, its nostrils are permanently closed, and it has to breathe
through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its
blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a
deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than
females. Its blue feet play a key role in courtship rituals and
breeding, with the male visually displaying his feet to attract mates
during the breeding season.

## Distribution and habitat

The blue-footed booby is distributed among the continental coasts of the
eastern Pacific Ocean from [California](California "wikilink") to the
Galápagos Islands south into Peru. It is strictly a marine bird. Its
only need for land is to breed and rear young, which it does along the
rocky coasts of the eastern Pacific.

A booby may use and defend two or three nesting sites, which consist of
bare black lava in small divots in the ground, until they develop a
preference for one a few weeks before the eggs are laid. These nests are
created as parts of large colonies. While nesting, the female turns to
face the sun throughout the day, so the nest is surrounded by excrement.

### Natal dispersal

Females start breeding when they are 1 to 6 years old, while males start
breeding when they are 2 to 6 years old. Very limited [natal
dispersal](Biological_dispersal "wikilink") occurs, meaning that young
pairs do not move far from their original natal nests for their own
first reproduction, leading to the congregation of hundreds of boobies
in dense colonies. The benefit of limited dispersal is that by staying
close to their parents' nesting sites, the boobies are more likely to
have a high-quality nest. Since their parents had successfully raised
chicks to reproductive age, their nest site must have been effective,
either by providing cover from [predation](predation "wikilink") and
[parasitism](parasitism "wikilink"), or by its suitability for taking
off and landing. Bigamy has been observed in the species, and cases
are known where two females and one male all share a single nest.

## Foot pigmentation

The blue color of the blue-footed booby's webbed feet comes from structures
of aligned collagens in the skin modified by
[carotenoid](carotenoid "wikilink") pigments obtained from its diet of
fresh fish. The collagens are arranged in a manner that makes the skin
appear blue. The underlying color is a "flat, purplish blue". That color
is modified by carotenoids to aquamarine in healthy birds. Carotenoids
also act as [antioxidants](antioxidants "wikilink") and stimulants for
the blue-footed booby's immune function, suggesting that carotenoid
pigmentation is an indicator of an individual's immunological
state. Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a
booby. Boobies that were experimentally food-deprived for 48 hours
experienced a decrease in foot brightness due to a reduction in the
amount of [lipids](lipid "wikilink") and
[lipoproteins](lipoprotein "wikilink") that are used to absorb and
transport carotenoids. Thus, the feet are rapid and honest indicators of
a booby's current level of nourishment. As blue feet are signals
that reliably indicate the immunological and health condition of a
booby, coloration is favored through [sexual
selection](sexual_selection "wikilink").

### Female selection

The brightness of the feet decreases with age, so females tend to mate
with younger males with brighter feet, which have higher
[fertility](fertility "wikilink") and greater ability to provide
paternal care than older males. In a
[cross-fostering](cross-fostering "wikilink") experiment, foot color
reflects paternal contribution to raising chicks; chicks raised by
foster fathers with brighter feet grew faster than chicks raised by
foster males with duller feet. Females continuously evaluate their
partners' condition based on foot color. In one experiment, males whose
partners had laid a first egg in the nest had their feet dulled by
makeup. The female partners laid smaller second eggs a few days later.
As duller feet usually indicate a decrease in health and possibly
genetic quality, it is adaptive for these females to decrease their
investment in the second egg. The smaller second eggs contained less
yolk concentration, which could influence embryo development, hatching
success, and subsequent chick growth and survival. In addition, they
contained less yolk [androgens](androgens "wikilink"). As androgen
plays an important role in chick survival, the experiment suggested
female blue-footed boobies use the attractiveness and perceived genetic
quality of their mates to determine how much resources they should
allocate to their eggs. This supports the differential allocation
theory, which predicts that parents care more for their offspring when
paired with attractive mates.

### Male selection

Males also assess their partner's reproductive value and adjust their
investment in the brood according to their partner's condition. Females
that lay larger and brighter eggs are in better condition and have
greater [reproductive
value](reproductive_value_(population_genetics) "wikilink"). Therefore,
males tend to display higher attentiveness and parental care to larger
eggs, since those eggs were produced by a female with apparent good
genetic quality. Smaller, duller eggs garnered less paternal care.
Female foot color is also observed as an indication of perceived female
condition. In one experiment, the color of eggs was muted by
researchers, males were willing to exercise similar care for both large
eggs and small eggs if their mate had brightly colored feet, whereas
males paired with dull-footed females only incubated larger eggs.
Researchers also found that males did not increase their care when
females exhibited both bright feet and high-quality offspring.

## Behavior and ecology

### Hunting and feeding

The blue-footed booby is a specialized fish eater, feeding on small
schooling fish such as [sardines](sardine "wikilink"),
[anchovies](anchovy "wikilink"), [mackerel](mackerel "wikilink"), and
[flying fish](flying_fish "wikilink"). It will also take
[squid](squid "wikilink") and [offal](offal "wikilink"). The blue-footed
booby hunts by diving into the ocean after prey, sometimes from a great
height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey. It can hunt
singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks. Boobies travel in parties of
about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the
lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it signals to the rest of the
group and they all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like
arrows.

Plunge diving can be done from heights of 10–30.5 m (33–100 ft) and even
up to 100 m (330 ft). These birds hit the water around 97 km/h (27 m/s) 
and can go to depths of 25 m (80 ft) below the water surface.
Their skulls contain special air sacs that protect the brain from
enormous pressure. Prey are usually eaten while the birds are still
under water. Individuals prefer to eat on their own instead of with
their hunting group, usually in the early morning or late afternoon.
Males and females fish differently, which may contribute to why
blue-foots, unlike other boobies, raise more than one young. The male is
smaller and has a proportionally larger tail, which enables the male to
fish in shallow areas and deep waters. The female is larger and can
carry more food. Both the male and female feed the chicks through
regurgitation.

### Breeding

The blue-footed booby is [monogamous](Monogamy_in_animals "wikilink"),
although it has the potential to be bigamous. It is an
[opportunistic breeder](opportunistic_breeder "wikilink"), with the
breeding cycle occurring every 8 to 9 months. The
[courtship](Courtship_display "wikilink") of the blue-footed booby
consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and
[dancing](mating_dance "wikilink") to impress the female. The male
begins by showing his feet, strutting in front of the female. Then, he
presents nest materials and finishes the mating ritual with a final
display of his feet. The dance also includes "sky-pointing", which
involves the male pointing his head and bill up to the sky while keeping
the wings and tail raised.

#### Rearing young

The blue-footed booby is one of only two species of booby that raises
more than one chick in a breeding cycle.

The female blue-footed booby lays two or three eggs, about four to five
days apart. Both male and female take turns incubating the eggs, while
the nonsitting bird keeps watch. Since the blue-footed booby does not
have a [brooding patch](brooding_patch "wikilink"), it uses its feet to
keep the eggs warm. The [incubation](Avian_incubation "wikilink") period
is 41–45 days. Usually, one or two chicks are hatched from the two or
three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental
[responsibilities](parental_investment "wikilink"). The male provides
food for the young in the first part of their lives because of his
specialized diving. The female takes over when the demand is higher.
Chicks feed off the [regurgitated](Regurgitation_(digestion) "wikilink")
fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent blue-footed booby does not have
enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick,
ensuring that at least one will survive.

Like other [sexually size-dimorphic](Sexual_dimorphism "wikilink")
birds, female blue-footed boobies usually favor the smaller sex during
times of food scarcity. Booby chicks do not show clear differences in
size based on sex, but females do grow faster than males, which means
they require greater parental investment. Blue-footed boobies display
behavior that is described in the flexible investment hypothesis, which
states that a female adjusts the allocation of resources to maximize her
lifetime reproductive success. This was shown in an experiment in which
females had their flight feathers trimmed, so that they had to expend
more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods. Female
chicks of such mothers were more strongly affected than their brothers,
in that they had lower masses and shorter wing lengths.

Fledglings are more likely to become reproductive adults when one parent
is old and the other young. The reason for this is unknown, but
nestlings with different aged parents are least infected by ticks.

#### Brood hierarchy due to asynchronous hatching

The blue-footed booby lays one to three eggs in one nest at a time,
although 80% of nests only contain two eggs. Eggs are laid five days
apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which
results in a difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches
four days before the other, so it receives a four-day head start in
growth compared to its younger sibling. This
[asynchronous](Synchronization "wikilink") hatching serves many
purposes. First, it spaces out the difficult time period in
[rearing](Parenting "wikilink") during which newborn chicks are too
feeble to accept [regurgitated](regurgitation_(digestion) "wikilink")
food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total
brood loss to predators such as the [milk
snake](milk_snake "wikilink").

Asynchronous hatching may also reduce [sibling
rivalry](sibling_rivalry "wikilink"). Experimentally manipulated
synchronous broods produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in
asynchronous broods were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably
occurs through a clearly established [brood
hierarchy](dominance_hierarchy "wikilink") in asynchronously hatched
siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital for the formation
of brood hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous broods established
them, as well), it does aid in efficient brood reduction when food
levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous broods die more
quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both
offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.

#### Facultative siblicide

Blue-footed booby chicks practice [facultative
siblicide](Siblicide "wikilink"), opting to cause the death of a sibling
based on environmental conditions. The A-chick, which hatches first,
will kill the younger B-chick if a food shortage exists. The initial
size disparity between the A-chick and B-chick is retained for at least
the first two months of life. During lean times, the A-chick may
attack the B-chick by pecking at its younger sibling vigorously, or it
may simply drag its younger sibling by the neck and oust it from the
nest. Experiments in which the necks of chicks were taped to inhibit
food ingestion showed that sibling aggression increased sharply when the
weight of the A-chicks dropped below 20-25% of their potential. A steep
increase in pecking occurred below that threshold, indicating that
siblicide is, in part, triggered by the dominant chick's weight, and not
simply by the size difference between the siblings. Younger broods
(those less than six weeks old) had three times the rate of pecking than
older broods. This is perhaps due to the relative inability of young
B-chicks to defend themselves against an A-chick attack.

The elder sibling also may harm the younger one by controlling access to
the food delivered by the parents. A-chicks always receive food before
B-chicks. Although subordinate chicks beg just as much as their dominant
siblings, the older chicks are able to divert the parents' attention to
themselves, as their large size and conspicuousness serve as more
effective stimuli.

However, another experiment showed that booby chicks do not operate
exclusively by the "leftovers hypothesis", where younger chicks are fed
only after the elder ones are completely satiated. Instead, researchers
identified a certain degree of tolerance towards the younger sibling
during short-term periods of food shortages. This hypothesis suggests
that the elder chicks reduce food intake moderately, just enough so that
the younger sibling does not starve. Although this system works during
short-term food shortages, it is unsustainable during prolonged periods
of dearth. In this latter case, the elder sibling usually becomes
aggressive and siblicidal.

#### Parental role in siblicide

Blue-footed booby parents are passive spectators of this intrabrood
conflict. They do not intervene in their offspring's struggles, even at
the point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the
demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality
between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding
the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, they
respond to the brood hierarchy and not to the level of
[begging](Begging_behavior_in_animals "wikilink") when deciding which
chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of
passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may
be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the
parents. The "insurance egg hypothesis" views the second egg and
resulting chick as insurance for the parent in case the first egg does
not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected.

However, booby parents may not be as indifferent as they seem. The
parental behavior described above may be masking [parent-offspring
conflict](parent-offspring_conflict "wikilink"). Blue-footed booby
parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of
the younger chick by the older sibling. This is in direct contrast to
the [masked booby](masked_booby "wikilink"), a species in which
siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject
younger chicks from their flat nests. When blue-footed booby nests were
experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original
steepness. Blue-footed booby chicks that were placed in masked booby
nests were more likely to engage in siblicide, which reveals that
parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Parents also
appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body
conditions during periods of food deprivation. Egg-mass analysis
shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season,
the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first.
Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater
fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any
disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into
the second egg. Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that no
parental favoritism seems to exist in regards to
[androgen](androgen "wikilink") allocation. This may simply be because
the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and
maximize parental reproductive output. What may at first appear to
be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic
parent-offspring conflict.

#### Long-term effects of hierarchies

A dominant-subordinate relationship always exists between chicks in a
brood. Although dominant A-chicks grow faster and survive past infancy
more often than subordinate B-chicks, no difference in reproductive
success is seen between the two types of siblings during adulthood. In
one longitudinal study, no long-term effects of dominance hierarchies
were apparent; in fact, subordinate chicks were often observed producing
nests of their own before their dominant siblings.

### Communication

Blue-footed boobies make raucous or polysyllabic grunts or shouts and
thin whistling noises. The males of the species have been known to throw
up their heads and whistle at a passing, flying female. These ritual
displays are also a form of communication.

Mates can recognize each other by their calls. Although calls differed
between sexes, unique individual signatures were present. Both males and
females can discriminate the calls of their mates from others.

### Population decline

Concerns of a decline in the booby population of the Galápagos Islands
prompted a research project in its cause. The project, completed in
April 2014, confirmed the population decline. The blue-footed booby
population appears to be having trouble breeding, thus is slowly
declining. The decline is feared to be long-term, but annual data
collection is needed for a firm conclusion that this is not a normal
fluctuation.

Food problems may be the cause of an observed failure of the birds to
even try to breed. This is related to a decline in sardines (*[Sardinops
sagax](Sardinops_sagax "wikilink")*), an important part of the boobies'
diet. Earlier work on [Española Island](Española_Island "wikilink") had
successful breeding in blue-footed boobies that have access to sardines,
in which case their diet consists essentially wholly of sardines.
However, sardines have been largely absent from the Española area since
1997, as has been shown from [Nazca boobies](Nazca_booby "wikilink")
there, which also prefer sardines, but can breed using other prey. In
2012–13, roughly only half of prey items in the boobies' diet were
sardines. No evidence was seen of other possible causes for the decline,
such as effects of humans, introduced predators, or disease.
