# Swifties



Swifties are the fandom of the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.
Regarded by journalists as one of the largest, most devoted, and
influential fan bases, Swifties are known for their high levels of
participation, creativity, community, fanaticism, and cultural impact on
the music industry and popular culture. They are a subject of widespread
coverage in the mainstream media.

Critics have opined that Swift has redefined artist–fandom relationships
by establishing an intimate connection with Swifties. She has frequently
engaged with, helped, credited and prioritized her fans, who have
offered unprecedented support and interest in her works irrespective of
her wavering reception in the media. They continued to support Swift
through her genre transitions, unexpected artistic pivots, and her
highly publicized controversies such as the 2019 masters dispute, while
instigating the political scrutiny of Ticketmaster that led to
implementation of various laws and stimulated economic growth with the
Eras Tour. Swift's releases, promotional efforts, and fashion have
garnered attention for incorporating Easter eggs and clues that are
decoded by Swifties and considered part of her musical universe.

Cultural analyses have variably described Swifties as a community of
interest, a subculture, and a near-metaverse, while academics have
studied them for their consumerism, content creation, social capital,
collective effervescence, organizing prolificacy, and interpersonal
relationships. The word Swiftie(s) was added to the Oxford Dictionary of
English in 2023. Swifties have also been a subject of criticism, with
some fans displaying disregard for Swift's privacy by publicizing her
real-time locations and engaging in verbal attack of individuals,
including celebrities, who malign Swift. On the other hand, some
Swifties criticize Swift for her lifestyle and professional choices,
which journalists disapprove as a parasocial relationship.





## History



Taylor Swift began writing, recording and releasing country music in
2006. Before releasing her debut single, "Tim McGraw" (2006), Swift had
been using social networking websites. She was one of the first country
artists to use the Internet as a marketing tool for her music,
predominantly promoting herself on Myspace and connecting with listeners
who liked her music when it played on radio. She created her MySpace
account on August 31, 2005, a day before her then-label, Big Machine
Records, was inaugurated. Swift's songs on MySpace collected more than
45 million listens, which Scott Borchetta, the label CEO, provided to
"skeptical" country radio programmers to convince them of existing fans
for Swift's songs.

Swift released her self-titled debut studio album in the United States
in October 2006. It sold 40,000 copies in its first week, but became a
sleeper hit as its sales remained consistent over time, reaching one
million copies in November 2007. It garnered its highest sales week in
January 2008, with 187,000 copies. This sleeper success contributed to a
rapid increase in Swift's notability within and beyond the country music
scene. Taylor Swift spent 24 weeks at the number-one spot of the U.S.
Top Country Albums chart and became the longest-running album from the
2000s decade on the all-genre Billboard 200. Her follow-up album,
Fearless, was released in November 2008 and became the best-selling
album of 2009. It achieved significant international success beyond the
Anglosphere, where country music was then not popular, and its singles
"Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" became crossover successes on pop
radio, catapulting Swift to mainstream fame and widening her audience.
The success planted dedicated fanbases for Swift in overseas markets
such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, Philippines, China,
Vietnam, Taiwan, India, and Japan. Her subsequent albums, which saw her
experiment with pop, rock, electronic, folk, and alternative styles,
helped enlarge her fanbase and diversify its demographics in the
following decades.





### Etymology

The word "Swiftie" for a Swift fan gained popularity in the late 2000s.
Etymologically, the word is formed from Swift's name and the suffix
"ie", which is often used in diminutives to imply affection. Swift
stated in a 2012 Vevo interview that her fans call themselves
"Swifties", which she found "adorable". Swift filed the term for
trademark in March 2017. In 2023, Oxford Dictionary of English defined
Swiftie as a noun meaning "an enthusiastic fan of the singer Taylor
Swift." As per the dictionary, some words that collocate with Swiftie in
popular usage are "fandom", "die-hard", "hardcore" and "self-
proclaimed". According to Dictionary.com, the term Swiftie often implies
that the person is "a very passionate and loyal fan—as opposed to just a
casual listener."





## Relationship with Swift





Swift maintains a close relationship with Swifties, to whom many
journalists attribute her cultural influence. To The Washington Post,
Swift and Swifties are "all part of one big friend group". She has
"revolutionized" the relationship a celebrity can have with fans,
according to The New York Times. Many fans feel connected to her as they
"have grown up with her and her music." Lora Kelley of The Atlantic
stated that Swift "understands the power of the group experience." Her
connection with fans is considered unique for artists of her stature;
she has interacted with them on social media, sent them gifts, hand-
selected them to attend intimate concerts or meet-and-greets, made
surprise visits, participated in some of their functions (such as a
wedding or a bridal shower), and gifted free tickets to disadvantaged or
medically ill fans. Swift's habit of lurking her fans online has been
referred to as "Taylurking" by the fans.



In June 2010, Swift hosted a 13-hour meet-and-greet as a part of the CMA
Festival in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2014, 2017 and 2019, she hosted the
"Secret Sessions", a series of pre-release album-listening parties for
fans at her houses, and a 2014 Christmas event dubbed by the fans as the
"Swiftmas," where Swift sent packages of early Christmas presents to
fans and hand-delivered some of them. Swift has also written songs in
honor of her fans, such as "Long Live" (2010) or "Ronan" (2012); the
latter is a charity record about a fan's four-year-old son who died of
neuroblastoma. In 2023, she invited 2,200 fans to the world premiere of
her concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, free of cost. Zoya Raza-
Sheikh of The Independent reported that Swift "remains at the forefront
of delivering fan-based experiences to cultivate an ever-growing
following. Whether it's personal invites to the singer's house for album
listening parties, aka Secret Sessions, or pre-show hangouts, she
continues to put her fans first."With her large fanbase, Swift is one of
the most followed people on social media. According to ticketing
executive Nathan Hubbard, Swift was the first musician ever "to be
natively online." Rolling Stone critic Brittany Spanos opined that Swift
grew her fanbase on social media: "She was using Tumblr way past its
prime. Twitter. She's now on TikTok, commenting on people's videos." The
part of TikTok dominated by Swifties is known as "SwiftTok". A 2024
qualitative study of Swifties credited "Swift's constant self-disclosure
and authentic persona on social media" for the Swifties' exceptional
relationship with Swift.

The nicknames generally used by Swifties for Swift include "Blondie"
(referencing her blonde hair), "T-Swizzle" (after the lyrics in Swift's
2009 parody song "Thug Story" with American record producer T-Pain), and
"The Music Industry" (referring to her influence on the music industry).
Chinese Swifties dubbed her "Meimei" (霉霉), a pun based on the Chinese
character "Mei" (霉) for "unlucky" that has since been adopted by Chinese
state media.

Swift has donated to fans to cover their academic loans, medical bills,
rent or other expenses. In 2018, she bought a house for a homeless and
pregnant fan. Her high donation to a fan with leukemia on GoFundMe in
2015 caused the crowdfunding platform to expand its donation cap. In
2023, thousands of Swifties collectively donated US$125,000 via GoFundMe
to the family of a fellow Swiftie who was struck and killed by a drunk
driver on his way home from a Swift concert. Much of the donated amount
was given in portions of $13, Swift's favorite number. When three
children were murdered and several other maimed at a Swift-themed event,
Swifties raised over £100,000 within a day to help the victims.

While Swifties are generally perceived as a fandom unanimously
supportive of Swift, members of the fanbase have also criticized her a
number of times throughout the years. Reasons include insufficient
political activism from Swift, such as during Donald Trump's election as
the 45th president of the U.S. or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and
the individuals she has been associated with in the media, such as Matty
Healy, who is known for his controversial statements. Swift has also
criticized her fans or some of her fans in certain lyrics of her
eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department (2024), prominently
in the tracks "But Daddy I Love Him" and "Who's Afraid of Little Old
Me?" for encroaching on her private life.





## Lore and community





Journalists describe Swift's works, celebrity, and the fanfare
surrounding them as a world of its own, dubbing it a music "universe"
subject to analyses by Swifties. Propagated by her prolific use of
Easter eggs and "unusually close connection with her fans", Swift is a
source of myth in popular culture. Her outfits, accessories, diction,
color coding, and numerology have also been Easter eggs. Swifties are
known for their fan theories, having gained a reputation as "the best
online sleuths" for breaking down and associating various elements they
consider as clues or Easter eggs. According to Bruce Arthur of Toronto
Star, "Swift is followed by fans whose dedication to her mythology is
Byzantine and layered and complex and messianic."

Glamour and The Washington Post termed the lore as the Taylor Swift
Cinematic Universe. Entertainment Weekly called it Taylor Swift Musical
Universe—"a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn
every piece of info into an online archaeological dig." In The Guardian,
Adrian Horton said "Swiftverse" is a subculture of mass media,
cultivated by "years of worldbuilding and Swiftian mythology", while
Alim Kheraj wrote Swift turned pop music into a "multiplayer puzzle"
involving fanbase commitment, which other artists have attempted to
reproduce. According to Sinéad O'Sullivan in The New Yorker, the
Swiftverse is "a fan universe, filled with complex, in-sequence
narratives that have been contextualized through multiple perspectives"
across Swift's albums.



Andrew Unterberger of Spin wrote that symbolisms are "inextricable
elements of the Taylor Swift experience" and key to understanding her
work. To Caroline Mimbs Nyce of The Atlantic, Swift's fandom is nearly a
metaverse: "a huge virtual community unmoored from a single platform,
based on a world around Taylor Swift, missing only the 3D virtual space
to hang out in." According to Yahr, Swift enjoys embedding "clues, hints
and puzzles" in her works, social media posts and interviews,
constructing a self-mythology that fans believe could have a hidden
meaning and attempt to decode, such as a release date, song or album
title or an artistic element. Madeline Merinuk of Today observed how
Swift's easter eggs, which originated as short messages hidden within
elaborate CD packaging, have become more innovative and intricate over
time. The critical analysis is referred to as "Swiftology" in the media.
For instance, "the scarf" mentioned in "All Too Well" has been a topic
of mythology.

Swift is known for her album rollouts and promotional concepts, often
referred to as "eras". Each era is characterized by an aesthetic idea,
color palette, mood, and a fashion style. As such, Swift has reinvented
her image and style throughout her career, which Ashley Lutz of Fortune
felt aided in broadening her fanbase. Today senior editor Elena Nicolaou
reported on how Swifties, who are mostly millennials, have incorporated
Swiftie culture into their weddings and other events.





### Sociological characteristics



Swifties have been described as a loyal fanbase with high levels of
participation and creativity; devoted fans in overseas countries such as
China translate her lyrics and coordinate large-scale Swift-related
events. Their positive reception of Reputation, which was released after
her 2016 controversy, demonstrated their commitment to her, irrespective
of a tonal shift in her artistry and public perception. Billboard wrote
the unprecedented success of Swift's re-recorded albums was further
evidence of their loyalty. According to Willman, the re-records' success
inspired other artists to "weaponize fans in their business disputes".
Author Amanda Petrusich described Swifties' allegiance as both "mighty
and frightening". The Guardian critic Rachel Aroesti wrote, "You can't
argue with her fanbase, immaculately devout and mind-bogglingly
populous." Swifties are a "force"—"a large and powerful group",
according to the music professor Paula Harper from the University of
Chicago.



The consumerist phenomenon of participating in or purchasing anything
related to Swift has been termed "the Taylor Swift effect" by
publications. To business scientists Brendan Canavan and Claire
McCamley, the relationship between Swift and Swifties represents post-
postmodern consumerism. Sociologist Brian Donovan opined, "it is easy to
dismiss the frenzy surrounding Swift as mindless hero worship. Yet, the
Swifties have shown the power of fandom to create social bonds that
transcend consumerism." He praised Swift's ability to "tap into the
collector mindset in her fandom". Arthur opined, "People like to frame
Swifties as an extreme case, but it sort of functions the same way as in
sports." Claire Cohen opined in The Standard that there is an underlying
misogyny in the way Swifties are portrayed by the media, often male
authors, as "some Victorian hysteria; irrational and shallow". Cohen
stated that "liking her music is looked down on by those who consider
themselves arbiters of what's culturally 'good enough', in the same way
as romantic literature by women is written-off as mere 'chick lit'."

The fan frenzy, generally termed "Swiftmania", has been considered the
21st-century equivalent to Beatlemania by journalists such as Jon Bream
of Star Tribune, who said "Swift has achieved a once unthinkable
monoculture, a zeitgeistian redux of Beatlemania". Shows and television
programs featuring Swift often experience viewership peaks due to
Swifties; Super Bowl LVIII experienced higher viewership due to Swift's
relationship with Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce. Apart from
music artists who have cited Swift as an influence, such as Olivia
Rodrigo, Halsey and Camila Cabello, various other celebrities have
described themselves as Swifties.





## Industrial impact





Swifties have been widely covered for their support for Swift in terms
of her commercial success. Swift is known for her large CD and vinyl
sales despite the 21st-century music scene having shifted to a largely
digital industry. From 2014 to 2015, Swift contested music streaming
services Spotify and Apple Music to regulate their policies to protect
artists' integrity. She announced that 1989, her first-ever pop music
album, would not release on Spotify, protesting the platform's
"minuscule" payments to musicians. Some journalists, such as Nilay Patel
of Vox, criticized Swift's beliefs; Patel said that the Internet
sabotaged the album format and claimed that most fans would not shop for
a Swift CD anymore. Many industry personnel felt that Swift's departure
from country music and streaming platforms would impact the album's
sales. Publications predicted 1989 to not sell over one million copies
in its first week like her previous albums Speak Now (2010) and Red
(2012) did. However, 1989 was an unprecedented success for Swift despite
the lack of streaming support, widely purchased by fans as CDs from
Target; the album sold 1.28 million copies in its opening week. In the
2020s, Swifties have also been credited with being one of the factors
behind the vinyl revival. Swift's album LP variants have been sold
exclusively at small businesses, driving their profits.

Swift's fans increased the publicity surrounding her 2019 masters
dispute with Big Machine and American businessman Scooter Braun and
drove the success of her re-recording efforts. An online petition
launched by a fan on Change.org, calling Braun and Borchetta "to stop
holding Swift's art hostage", garnered 35,000 plaintiffs in its first
three hours. Michael Jones, a managing director of Change.org, described
the petition as "one the fastest-growing petitions on the platform this
month". Braun, however, claimed that Swift "weaponized" her fanbase by
making the dispute public. Swifties also discovered that the Carlyle
Group, a partner of Braun in the dispute, supplies weapons to the civil
war in Yemen, which was confirmed by publications such as The New York
Times.

Swift's works, including concert tours such as the Eras Tour, are known
to stimulate surrounding economies. The economic impact—driven largely
by Swifties and attributed to the "booming" travel, lodging, cosmetic,
fashion, and food businesses—boosts tourism revenues of cities by large
margins. The Los Angeles Times described Swifties as an economic
microcosm. In November 2022, the U.S. pre-sale of the Eras Tour was
mishandled by Ticketmaster, receiving widespread public and political
scrutiny. Due to "astronomical" fan demand, the Ticketmaster website
crashed but 2.4 million tickets had been sold, breaking the record for
the most concert tickets sold by an artist in a single day. Ticketmaster
attributed the crash to "historically unprecedented" site traffic. Fans
and consumer groups accused Ticketmaster of deceit and monopoly. The
intense fan reactions caused several members of U.S. Congress to
highlight the merger of Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation
Entertainment, and the U.S. Department of Justice to open an
investigation into Live Nation–Ticketmaster, while several fans sued the
companies for intentional deception, fraud, price fixing, and antitrust
law violations. Under pressure from U.S. president Joe Biden,
Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies agreed to terminate junk
fees. Entertainment Weekly and The A.V. Club listed "Swifties vs.
Ticketmaster" as one of the biggest cultural news stories of 2022. CNN
journalist Allison Morrow wrote in an article titled "One Nation, Under
Swift" that Swift's fans united the parties against Ticketmaster in a
way "the Founding Fathers failed to anticipate".

Noticing the growing trend of Swift-themed dance parties in the world,
industry commentators found that Swift's cultural position as a staple
in the 21st-century music landscape allowed nightclubs to profit from
her by hosting specialized events for fans. One such party is
"Swiftogeddon", which began as a one-off Swiftie event in London and
grew into a U.K.-wide club-night tour that sells out every weekend.
American reality television programs such as Dancing with the Stars and
The Voice hosted special Swift-themed nights in 2023. Swiftie trends
have also inspired various brands. The A.V. Club stated that "usually,
pop stars are products and fandom is the consumer", but Swifties are a
product themselves. For instance, the phrase "seemingly ranch" became
viral after a fan account on Twitter used it to caption a photo of
Swift's snacks at a National Football League (NFL) game, spawning a
string of memes and causing food companies like Heinz, McDonald's, KFC,
Hidden Valley and Primal Kitchen to pick it up for their products and
marketing.





## Demographics





According to a 2023 survey by Morning Consult, in the U.S., 53% of
adults said they were fans of Swift, of whom 44% identified as Swifties
and 16% as her "avid" fans. Of the fans, 52% were women while 48% were
men. Racially, the 74% of the fans were white, 13% were Black, 9% were
Asian, and 4% from other races. Politically, 55% of the fans were
Democratic, 23% were Republican, and 23% were independent. In terms of
generations, 45% are millennials, 23% are baby boomers, 21% are
Generation X, and 11% are Generation Z. Journalists have also noted an
increase in Swift's boomer and Generation X fans, known as "senior
Swifties".





### Political role



Brooke Schultz of the Associated Press called Swifties an influential
voter demographic in U.S. politics: "the sheer power and size of Swift's
fandom has spurred conversations about economic inequality, merely
symbolized by Ticketmaster". According to a 2023 survey reported by The
Times, 53% adult Americans consider themselves "fans" of Swift, ratings
that journalist Ellie Austin said Biden and Trump "can only dream of".
Austin explained that though Swift herself is left-aligned, some
conservatives still "covet" her, making her a deciding factor in the
U.S. politics. In May 2023, Texas approved the law titled "Save Our
Swifties", banning the use of bots to bulk-purchase tickets. Similar
bills were launched in various U.S. states and the U.S. Congress.
Internationally, presidential candidates such as Gabriel Boric in Chile
and Leni Robredo in the Philippines have appealed or marketed themselves
to Swifties during their respective election campaigns. The Islamic
State (ISIS) planned to mass-murder attendees of one of Swift's Eras
Tour concerts in Vienna, Austria, but the plot was subsequently thwarted
by Austrian authorities.





## Accolades







## Criticism



Swifties have received criticism for certain behaviors. Journalists have
denounced the parasocial interactions that some Swifties have with
Swift, including excessive interest in Swift's private life. Fans have
swarmed locations where she is spotted. Swift herself has spoken about
her lack of privacy many times. In Miss Americana, when Swift leaves her
Tribeca apartment surrounded by fans and spectators outside her door,
she states that she is "highly aware of the fact that that is not
normal."

Some fans have also been reported to attack, harass or send death
threats online to, and dox other celebrities, journalists, and Internet
users for various reasons, such as speaking negatively of Swift.
Following the masters dispute, Braun claimed that he received death
threats from Swifties. Vice called the fandom an "equal-parts welcoming
yet gate-kept community caught in the throes of idealistic, obsessive
celebrity culture".





### Gaylor

Gaylor is a conspiracy theory that claims Swift is secretly gay. A small
faction of Swifties, who call themselves "Gaylors", support and promote
the theory, believing that Swift hints at her queerness through her
music and lifestyle, although she has stated she is "not part of" the
LGBT community but rather an ally. Some Gaylors specifically ship Swift
with Karlie Kloss, Dianna Agron, or both, claiming Swift dated them in
the past, and accuse Swift of queerbaiting if she is not gay. Most
Swifties criticize Gaylor theories as far-fetched, malicious, and
disrespectful to Swift. Journalists likewise dismiss it as an invasive
and baseless conspiracy theory.

Gaylors have alleged that a number of songs released by Swift confirm
her romantic interest in women and that she was romantically involved
with actresses Emma Stone and Cara Delevigne as well. They claimed that
Swift's 2023 song "When Emma Falls in Love" is an acknowledgement of her
relationship with Stone although Swift and Stone have only referred to
each other as close friends in the media. However, the majority of
Swifties consider the past relationship between Stone and actor Andrew
Garfield as the inspiration for the song.

In the album prologue to 1989 (Taylor's Version), Swift acknowledged
that her female friendships have been sexualized like the tabloid media
coverage of her male acquaintances. A January 2024 opinion article by
writer Anna Marks, published in The New York Times, speculated that
Swift is a closeted queer person based on Marks' perceptions of Swift's
lyrics and aesthetics, drawing criticism from Swifties and other
readers. Subsequently, CNN Business reported that Swift's personnel
found the article "invasive, untrue and inappropriate".





## Academic study





Swifties have been the subject of journalistic and academic interest,
studied for their social capital, consumerist characteristics and
interpersonal relationships. Their "prolific content creation, digital
savvy, organizing capacity, and sometimes vicious online behaviors" are
also subjects of study, as per Internet culture researchers Cristina
López and Avneesh Chandra. Donovan distinguished "Taylor Swift fans"
from Swifties, opining that the latter are a subculture characterized by
collective effervescence, unlike other fanbases. Some linguists termed
the Swifties' fan-coded, lyrics-based language a "fanilect". A 2023
network map published by López and Chandra divided Swifties into six
distinct factions based on online interactions and topics of discussion.
A 2024 qualitative study of Indonesian Swifties claimed that the
parasocial interaction with Swift and the interactions between Swifties
satiates the fans' "social media gratifications for entertainment,
social interactions, and information-seeking." Various universities also
host fan clubs dedicated to Swift.
