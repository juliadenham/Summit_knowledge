# Zebu

The **zebu** (; ***Bos indicus*** or ***Bos taurus indicus***),
sometimes known in the plural as **indicine cattle**, **Camel cow** or
**humped cattle**, is a [species](species "wikilink") or
[subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") of [domestic
cattle](Bos_taurus "wikilink") originating in [South
Asia](South_Asia "wikilink").[1] Zebu, like many [Sanga
cattle](Sanga_cattle "wikilink") breeds, differs from taurine cattle by
a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large [dewlap](dewlap "wikilink"),
and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding [high
temperatures](Tropical_climate "wikilink") and are farmed throughout the
[tropics](tropics "wikilink").

Zebu are used as [draught](draught_animal "wikilink") and [riding
animals](riding_animal "wikilink"), [dairy
cattle](dairy_cattle "wikilink") and [beef
cattle](beef_cattle "wikilink"), as well as for byproducts such as
[hides](Hide_(skin) "wikilink") and [dung](Feces "wikilink") for
[fuel](fuel "wikilink") and [manure](manure "wikilink"). Some small
breeds such as the [miniature zebu](Miniature_Zebu "wikilink") are also
kept as [pets](pet "wikilink").

In some regions, such as parts of [India](Religion_in_India "wikilink"),
zebu and other cattle have significant [religious
meaning](Cattle_in_religion#In_Indian_religions "wikilink").

## Taxonomy and name

Both [scientific names](scientific_name "wikilink") *Bos taurus* and
*Bos indicus* were introduced by [Carl
Linnaeus](Carl_Linnaeus "wikilink") in 1758, with the latter used to
[describe](Species_description "wikilink") humped cattle in
[China](China_proper "wikilink").[2]

The zebu was classified as a distinct [species](species "wikilink") by
[Juliet Clutton-Brock](Juliet_Clutton-Brock "wikilink") in 1999,[3] but
as a [subspecies](subspecies "wikilink") of the domestic
[cattle](cattle "wikilink"), *Bos taurus indicus*, by both Clutton-Brock
and [Colin Groves](Colin_Groves "wikilink") in 2004 and by [Peter
Grubb](Peter_Grubb_(zoologist) "wikilink") in 2005.[4][5] In 2011,
Groves and Grubb classified it as a distinct species again.[6]

The [American Society of
Mammalogists](American_Society_of_Mammalogists "wikilink") considers it
part of the species *Bos taurus* in analogy to [Sanga
cattle](Sanga_cattle "wikilink") (*Bos taurus africanus* ).[7] The
[ICZN](International_Commission_on_Zoological_Nomenclature "wikilink")
has not yet published a ruling on the classification of domestic
derivatives and no scientific body advocates the abolition of the
[Biological Species
Concept](Species_concept#Mayr's_Biological_Species_Concept "wikilink")
for domestic animals.

## Origin

Zebu cattle were found to derive from the [Indian
form](Indian_aurochs "wikilink") of
[aurochs](Aurochs#Taxonomy_and_evolution "wikilink") and have first been
[domesticated](domesticate "wikilink") between 7,000 and 6,000
[YBP](YBP "wikilink") at [Mehrgarh](Mehrgarh "wikilink"), present-day
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"), by people linked to or coming from
[Mesopotamia](Mesopotamia "wikilink").[8][9][10][11] Indicine cattle
farming is understood to have spread across much of South Asia by 2000
BCE.

Its wild ancestor, the Indian aurochs, [became
extinct](Holocene_extinction#Historic_extinction "wikilink") during the
[Indus Valley civilisation](Indus_Valley_civilisation "wikilink") likely
due to habitat loss, caused by expanding pastoralism and interbreeding
with domestic zebu.[12][13] Its latest remains ever found were dated to
3,800 YBP, making it the first of the three [aurochs
subspecies](Aurochs#Taxonomy_and_evolution "wikilink") to die
out.[14][15][16]

Archaeological evidence including depictions on pottery and rocks
suggests that humped cattle likely imported from the [Near
East](Ancient_Near_East "wikilink") was present in
[Egypt](Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt "wikilink") around 4,000
[YBP](Before_Present "wikilink"). Its first appearance in the
[Subsahara](Subsahara "wikilink") is dated to after 700 AD and it was
introduced to the [Horn of Africa](Horn_of_Africa "wikilink") around
1000.[17]

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the zebu [Y
chromosome](Y_chromosome "wikilink") [haplotype](haplotype "wikilink")
groups are found in three different lineages: Y3A, the most predominant
and cosmopolitan lineage; Y3B, only observed in West Africa; and Y3C,
predominant in south and northeast India.[18]

## Characteristics

Zebu, but also
many Sanga cattle have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps and droopy
ears.[19] Sanga cattle can be distinguished from purebred zebu by their
having smaller humps located farther forward.

Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot
[savanna](Tropical_savanna_climate "wikilink") and
[steppe](Semi-arid_climate#Hot_semi-arid_climates "wikilink")
environments. These adaptations result in higher tolerance for drought,
heat and sunlight exposure.[20] Unlike many Sanga cattle however, zebu
does not exhibit [trypanotolerance](trypanotolerance "wikilink"), making
it susceptible to [nagana](nagana "wikilink"),[21][22] as evidenced by
the pattern of zebu [introgression](introgression "wikilink") into
African cattle.[23]

Furthermore, another important characteristic of the Zebu is that they
are .[24]

## Reproduction

Zebu are generally mature enough to give birth when they are 29 months
old. This is based on the development of their bodies to withstand the
strain of carrying the calf and lactation. Early reproduction can place
too much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. The
gestation period averages 285 days, but varies depending on the age and
nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the
carrying time, as male calves are carried for a longer period than
females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the overall
health of the animal and in return may also affect the gestation
period.[25]

## Behavior

Studies on the natural weaning of zebu cattle have shown that cows wean
their calves over a 2-week period, but after that, continue to show
strong affiliatory behavior with their offspring and preferentially
choose them for grooming and as grazing partners for at least 4–5
years.[26]

## Breeds and hybrids

Zebu are very common in much of Asia, including Pakistan, India,
[Nepal](Nepal "wikilink"), [Bangladesh](Bangladesh "wikilink") and
China. In Asia, taurine cattle are mainly found in the northern regions
such as [Japan](Japan "wikilink"), [Korea](Korea "wikilink"), northern
China and [Mongolia](Mongolia "wikilink"). In China, taurine cattle are
most common in northern breeds, zebu more common in southern breeds,
with hybrids in between.[27][28]

Zebu were imported to Africa since the [Bronze
Age](Bronze_Age "wikilink") and crossed with taurine cattle. Genetic
analysis of African cattle found higher proportions of zebu genes along
the [East African](East_Africa "wikilink") coast, with hardly any
taurine component on [Madagascar](Madagascar "wikilink"), either
implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or
the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (via
[Pakistan](Pakistan "wikilink"), [Iran](Iran "wikilink"),
[Yemen](South_Arabia "wikilink")).

Partial resistance to [rinderpest](rinderpest "wikilink") caused a
further increase of zebu breeds in Africa.

Geneticists at the [International Livestock Research Institute
(ILRI)](International_Livestock_Research_Institute "wikilink") in
Nairobi, Kenya and in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia discovered that cattle had
been domesticated in Africa independently of domestication in the Near
East. They concluded that the southern African cattle populations derive
originally from East Africa rather than from a southbound migration of
taurine cattle.[29] The results are inconclusive as to whether
domestication occurred first in Africa or the Near East.[30]

Other scientists consider the African [Sanga
cattle](Sanga_cattle "wikilink") breeds to have originated from
hybridization of zebu with leading to the
[Afrikaner](Afrikaner_cattle "wikilink"), [Red
Fulani](Red_Fulani_cattle "wikilink"),
[Ankole](Ankole_(cattle) "wikilink"), [Boran](Boran_cattle "wikilink")
and [many other](Sanga_cattle#Breeds_of_Sanga_cattle "wikilink") breeds.

Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African and
Indian breeds.

Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the
[Hariana](Haryanvi_cattle "wikilink") from
[Haryana](Haryana "wikilink"), [Punjab](Punjab,_India "wikilink")[31] or
the [Rath](Rathi_cattle "wikilink") from [Alwar
district](Alwar_district "wikilink"),
[Rajasthan](Rajasthan "wikilink").[32]

Zebu, which are adapted to [high temperatures](tropics "wikilink"),[33]
were imported into [Brazil](Brazil "wikilink") in the early 20th
century. Their importation marked a change in cattle ranching in Brazil
as they were considered "ecological" since and their meat was lean and
without chemical residues.[34]

In the early 20th century in Brazil, Zebu were crossbred with [Charolais
cattle](Charolais_cattle "wikilink"), a European taurine breed. The
resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the
[Canchim](Canchim "wikilink"). It has a better meat quality than the
zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle. The zebu breeds
used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat. Another
Charolais cross-breed with Brahmans is called [Australian
Charbray](Australian_Charbray "wikilink") and is recognised as a breed
in some countries.

From the 1960s onwards, [Nelore](Nelore "wikilink") which is an off
breed of [Ongole Cattle](Ongole_Cattle "wikilink") became the primary
breed of [cattle](cattle "wikilink") in Brazil because of its hardiness,
heat-resistance, and because it thrives on poor-quality forage and
breeds easily, with the calves rarely requiring human intervention to
survive. Currently more than 80% of [beef
cattle](beef_cattle "wikilink") in Brazil (approximately 167,000,000
animals) are either purebred or hybrid [Ongole
Cattle](Ongole_Cattle "wikilink") which is originated from Ongle region
of Andhra Pradesh.

## Uses

Zebu are used as [draught](draught_animal "wikilink") and [riding
animals](riding_animal "wikilink"), [beef
cattle](beef_cattle "wikilink"), [dairy
cattle](dairy_cattle "wikilink"), as well as for byproducts such as
hides, [dung](Feces "wikilink") for [fuel](fuel "wikilink") and
[manure](manure "wikilink"), and horn for knife handles and the like.
Zebu, mostly [miniature zebu](Miniature_Zebu "wikilink"), are kept as
[pets](pet "wikilink").[35] In India, the number of draft cattle in 1998
was estimated at 65.7 million head.[36]

Zebu cows commonly have low production of milk. They do not produce milk
until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much. When
zebus are crossed with taurine cattle, milk production generally
increases.[37]

In 1999, researchers at [Texas A&M
University](Texas_A&M_University "wikilink") successfully
[cloned](Cloning "wikilink") a zebu.[38]

*[Jallikattu](Jallikattu "wikilink")* in India is a bull taming sport
differing from European bullfighting in that humans are unarmed and the
bulls are not killed.

In [Madagascar](Madagascar "wikilink"), zebu outnumber people, and there
are an "astonishing" 6,813 [Malagasy](Malagasy_language "wikilink")
proverbs, common sayings, and expressions referring to zebu in parlance
on the island.[39] Zebu are wrestled by young men in a competitive
ritual of courtship called
*[tolon'omby](tolon'omby "wikilink")*.[40][41]

### Hindu tradition

Zebu are venerated within the [Hindu](Hinduism "wikilink") religion of
India. In the [Vedic period](Historical_Vedic_religion "wikilink") they
were a symbol of plenty.[42] In later times they gradually acquired
their present status. According to the
*[Mahabharata](Mahabharata "wikilink")*, they are to be treated with the
same respect 'as one's mother'.[43] In the middle of the first
millennium, the consumption of beef began to be disfavoured by
lawgivers.[44] Cows appear in numerous stories from the
[Vedas](Veda "wikilink") and [Puranas](Purana "wikilink"). The deity
[Krishna](Krishna "wikilink") was brought up in a family of cowherders,
and given the name [Govinda](Govinda "wikilink") (protector of the
cows). Also, [Shiva](Shiva "wikilink") is traditionally said to ride on
the back of a bull named [Nandi](Nandi_(bull) "wikilink").

Milk and milk products were used in Vedic rituals.[45] In the postvedic
period products of the cow—milk, curd, ghee, but also cow dung and urine
([gomutra](gomutra "wikilink")), or the combination of these five
([panchagavya](panchagavya "wikilink"))—began to assume an increasingly
important role in [ritual purification](ritual_purification "wikilink")
and expiation.[46]
